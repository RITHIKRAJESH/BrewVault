**☕ BrewVault - Connecting Farmers, Wholesalers, and Retailers**

BrewVault is a MERN stack-based web platform that connects farmers producing agricultural products like tea leaves and coffee beans with wholesalers, who further process and package these products.
Retailers can then browse and purchase the processed tea and coffee products directly from wholesalers, creating a seamless, technology-driven supply chain.

Through BrewVault, farmers can sell their raw products at fair market prices, wholesalers can manage their bulk inventory, and retailers can easily source high-quality processed goods for resale — all in one integrated, easy-to-use platform.

Key Highlights:

Farmers list raw tea and coffee products.

Wholesalers buy from farmers, process, and list finished goods.

Retailers purchase processed products from wholesalers.

Order management, inventory tracking, and secure payments integrated.

Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for performance and scalability.
